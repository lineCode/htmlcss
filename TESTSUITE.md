Notes About the Test Suite Directory
====================================

The "testsuite" directory contains files used by the `testhtmlcss` program to
verify the proper operation of the HTMLCSS library.


HTML and CSS Files
------------------

Most of the HTML and CSS files are my original creation.  Many come from the
HTMLDOC test suite.  The "source-sans-pro.css" file is part of the Adobe open
font project - see "Font Files" below.


Image Files
-----------

Most of the image files are my original creation.  The "logo.gif" file is the
original logo of a company I founded and later closed after 17 years when I
went to work for Apple...

The PNG test images come from Willem van Schaik's
[PngSuite](http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/).  The license for these images can
be found in the file "pngsuite-LICENSE.md".


Font Files
----------

The test fonts are all from Adobe's open font project.  The license for these
fonts can be found in the file "Source-LICENSE.md".  The selection of font files
was driven by a need to test selection of different weights and styles from CSS
and to test support for Unicode character ranges - the Japanese regional set is
the smallest...
